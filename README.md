# Crack_it


Crack_it is a **password security awareness project** developed by the students of Intech Sud Nîmes between March and July 2020.
The aim of the project is to offer a password reliability testing solution based on an automated and optimized dictionary construction.

The project was initiated by Jonathan Durant, lecturer and speaker on cybersecurity.
